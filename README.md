# Using The NIST Cybersecurity Framework: Responding to a Security Incident

Provided a sample scenario, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack on a multimedia company offering web design and social media marketing services. The incident compromised the company's internal network for two hours due to a flood of ICMP packets, leading to a thorough investigation and the development of a robust security strategy based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). I documented the incident response using the five core functions of NIST CSF: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.
